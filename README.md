## Introduction

### This project should no longer be used on new Laravel projects. We made a separate package for independent [authentication without a GUI](https://github.com/laravel/fortify), and also created a [beautifully designed application scaffolding using Tailwind CSS](https://github.com/laravel/jetstream).


While Laravel does not dictate which JavaScript or CSS pre-processors you use, it does provide a basic starting point using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and / or [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) that will be helpful for many applications. By default, Laravel uses [NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/) to install both of these frontend packages.
